## The new St. Andrews project

Let's clean sheet a new website. Once it is well along, production code can go into `~/dev/standrews`.

- Usung CSS variables.
- Using the `picture` element rather than the `figure` element.

## Kevin Powell Methods

Kevin likes to start off his css with

```css
*,
*::before,
*::after {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
body {
  margin: 0;
}
```
